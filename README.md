# Dynamic Capability Acquisition Protocol (DCAP)

> **"Tool Discovery for AI agents - with the ability to call what you discover"**

DCAP is a decentralized protocol enabling autonomous agents to discover, evaluate, and acquire computational capabilities at runtime through semantic broadcasting. Version 2.5 introduces structured connector information, allowing agents to not just discover tools, but autonomously invoke them.

## üéØ Quick Start

**Latest Specification:** [DCAP.md](./DCAP.md) - **Version 2.5** (October 2025)

**For automation/parsing:** Always fetch `DCAP.md` - it's a stable URL that always points to the latest version.

## üìã Current Version: 2.5

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Dynamic tool acquisition** with structured `connector` object  
‚úÖ **MCP transport support** (stdio, SSE, HTTP streaming)  
‚úÖ **Structured authentication** (x402, bearer, API key, none)  
‚úÖ **Protocol specification** (MCP, REST, gRPC)  
‚úÖ **Autonomous capability invocation** without manual configuration  

### What's New in v2.5

**Added `connector` object to `semantic_discover`:**
```json
{
  "connector": {
    "transport": "http",
    "endpoint": "https://robonet.example.com:8080/mcp",
    "auth": {
      "type": "x402",
      "required": true,
      "details": {
        "network": "base-sepolia",
        "asset": "0x036CbD...",
        "currency": "USDC"
      }
    },
    "protocol": {
      "type": "mcp",
      "version": "2024-11-05"
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- `connector.transport`: MCP transport type (stdio/sse/http)
- `connector.endpoint`: WHERE to connect (URL or command)
- `connector.auth`: Authentication requirements with structured details
- `connector.protocol`: Protocol type, version, and methods
- **The unlock**: Agents can now discover AND invoke tools without pre-configuration

**Full changelog:** See [archive/v2.5.md](./archive/v2.5.md)

## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### For Tool Providers

**Recommended:** Implement [DCAP.md](./DCAP.md) (v2.5)

```javascript
// Broadcast semantic_discover with connector details
{
  "v": 2,
  "t": "semantic_discover",
  "sid": "your-tool-id",
  "tool": "read_file",
  "does": "Reads file contents from filesystem",
  "when": ["need file contents", "read configuration"],
  "connector": {
    "transport": "http",
    "endpoint": "https://your-server.com:8080/mcp",
    "auth": {
      "type": "x402",
      "required": true,
      "details": {
        "network": "base-sepolia",
        "asset": "0x036CbD...",
        "currency": "USDC"
      }
    },
    "protocol": {
      "type": "mcp",
      "version": "2024-11-05"
    }
  }
}

// Continue sending perf_update as usual
{
  "v": 2,
  "t": "perf_update",
  "sid": "your-tool-id",
  "tool": "read_file",
  "exec_ms": 45,
  "success": true
}
```

### For Agent Consumers

**Recommended:** Implement [DCAP.md](./DCAP.md) (v2.5)

- Parse `connector` object from `semantic_discover` messages
- Implement MCP transport support (stdio, SSE, HTTP streaming)
- Handle authentication requirements (x402, bearer, API key)
- Dynamically connect to discovered tools without pre-configuration

### For Intelligence Systems

**Required:** Implement [DCAP.md](./DCAP.md) (v2.5)

```javascript
// Index tools by transport and auth requirements
const tool = {
  ...semanticDiscoverMessage,
  transport: connector.transport,
  authType: connector.auth.type
};

// Include connector info in recommendations
function recommendTool(query) {
  const match = findSemanticMatch(query);
  return {
    tool: match.tool,
    connector: match.connector,  // Agent can now invoke directly
    reasoning: "..."
  };
}
```

## üéì Philosophy

DCAP is **Google for AI agents** - but with the ability to call any discovered capability:

- **Discovery + Invocation**: Not just "what exists" but "how to reach it"
- **Autonomous acquisition**: Agents extend their capabilities without human configuration
- **Open participation**: Broadcast your tools, accept any transport, embrace any auth
- **Network effects**: More tools = more intelligence = more value
- **Evolution over perfection**: Watch what emerges, adapt the protocol

**"Discovery is powerful. Discovery + autonomous invocation is transformative."**
